# Deep reinforcement learning to achive electron transport on quantum dot
[![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/jupyter-guide/ten-rules-jupyter.svg)](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/mmtf-spark/blob/master/LICENSE)

This notebook uses two implementations of a deep reinforcement algorithm in a coherent transport problem over a system of coupled quantum dots.
First one is the [Baseline](https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines) (see Notebook 2 in the notebooks folder) implementation, from an external library which is the one that performs the better. The second one is a proper implementation using the Keras library.
